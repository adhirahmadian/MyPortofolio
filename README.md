# _Project Data Science_
I did this Project using python version 3. Click the link on each project to see the data and a complete explanation.

## **Project 1**
In this project, I made a prediction whether a prospective customer will pay off his loan.

**Overview**

>LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending company from USA headquartered in San Francisco, California. This company provides the first peer-to-peer loan with security services as a selling point, namely the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in addition the company also offers trading loans on the secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.

**Result**

>After being tested by random data using this model, I'm sure 89% can predict whether a prospective customer can pay off his loan.

## **Project 2**
In this project I will evaluate a regression model to predict house prices based on certain specifications.

**Overview**

>This dataset contains the selling price of homes for King County to cover Seattle, USA. This data includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.

**Result**

>![model](/house_price_predict.png)

>The results of this modeling is able to predict with accuracy above 80% and better if the data used were for houses with prices below 2 million dollars. I tried to predict the price of the house with random data which was sold for 383.000 dollars and I managed to predict the price of that house was 387.413 dollars.
