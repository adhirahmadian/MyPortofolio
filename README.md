# _Project Data Science_
I did this Project using python version 3. Click the link on each project to see the data and a complete explanation.

## **Project 1**
In this project, I made a prediction whether a prospective customer will pay off his loan.

**Overview**

>LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending company from USA headquartered in San Francisco, California. This company provides the first peer-to-peer loan with security services as a selling point, namely the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in addition the company also offers trading loans on the secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.

**Result**

>After being tested by random data using this model, I'm sure 89% can predict whether a prospective customer can pay off his loan.

## **Project 2**
In this project I will evaluate a regression model to predict house prices based on certain specifications.

**Overview**

>This dataset contains the selling price of homes for King County to cover Seattle, USA. This data includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.

**Result**

>![model](/house_price_predict.png)

>The results of this modeling is able to predict with accuracy above 80% and better if the data used were for houses with prices below 2 million dollars. I tried to predict the price of the house with random data which was sold for 383.000 dollars and I managed to predict the price of that house was 387.413 dollars.

## **Project 3**
In this project, I use YFinance to solve the problem of downloading stock data by offering a reliable, threaded, and Pythonic way to download historical market data from Yahoo! finance.

**Overview**

>I want to see the effect of pandemic lockdown policy to stock market in various aspect, like finance (BCA), daily utility (Unilever), and communication (Telkom).

**Result**

>![model](/close.png)

>we can see that in early april the stock market in all sector (representative) is plummeted because of pandemic lockdown policy. Daily utility has the biggest drop stock because lack of worker working in the factory, so the company can't produce their item like usuall of lockdown policy, but now the stock is recovering

## **Project 4**
In this project, I want to see movie recommendations based on the similarity between my preferences.

**Overview**

>When i watch a movie, the hype of the after movie is still remain and sometime make me  feel like 'i like that movie! i want to watch a movie like that again but with different plot' so i make this recommender-system to solve my problem. 

**Result**

>For example, I want to watch another movie like starwars, so here it is top 5 recommendation from the algorithm.

Movie Title | Correlation | Total Rating
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) |	1.000000 |	251
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) |	0.777970 |	211
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) |	0.734230 |	196
Fugitive, The (1993) |	0.482078 |	190
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) |	0.410916 |	140

>The value of Correlation represent of a-movie-that-is-look-like, the higher the value (max = 1) the more like the movie.
